            <p class="content_desc">Paired Life is one of the best dating apps 
                for encouraging women to make the first move. The app can 
                help you line up dates or make new friends, with the power to connect 
                in the hands of its women users. In fact, even if you're not in 
                the market for romance, Bumble may be worth trying out just to meet 
                new people and broaden your circle of friends.</p>
